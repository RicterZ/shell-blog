If a vulnerability is found in a vendor's product, I will attempt to contact
the vendor by email to notify with vulnerability detail. If the vulnerability
be marked as wontfix, I will report it to CVE / CNNVD official. The detail will
not be published until the vendor fixed the vulneraility or without 90 days.

[ Day 15 ] (With no reply of the report) Assignment of CVE / CNNVD
[ Day 90 ] CVE publication request submitted to Mitre, or publish the detail
